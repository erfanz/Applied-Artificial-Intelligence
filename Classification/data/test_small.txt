 Subject: erisk interview vince : you may inteersted in the following interview which appeared on erisk . com last friday . were rick buy ' s comments about real options taken out of context ? yann bonduelle leads a 25 - person team for in london that applies decision analytics and real options theory to dilemmas ranging from valuing a biotechnology product to deciding whether to kill off an internet financial services business . here he talks to rob jameson about whether this " theoretical " approach to risky decision - making really helps businesses in their day - to - day balancing of risk and reward . yann holds a ph . d degree from the engineering - economic systems department at stanford university , where he studied how to apply engineering decision and design analysis to wider economic , social and business issues . he then worked as a consultant applying his decision analysis methodologies to problems that included consumer decision making about innovative products such as electrical vehicles , before joining the team in 1998 where he is now a partner . he has written widely on the application of real options , particularly in fields of life sciences , technology , and e - business , and has a special interest in the relationship between risk assessment , validation of risk data and financial valuation . how would you sum up your approach to business decision analytics ? most of our projects are set up to help businesses that face massive uncertainties of some kind . decision analysis helps people explore problems , and redesign their decision - making process to increase the chance of them making the right choices . for example , imagine a biotechnology company that has to decide whether to put itself up for sale , enter a strategic relationship , or continue to go it alone . each of those options will lead on to other value - enhancing or value - destroying scenarios . we work with the client firstly to understand and challenge the assumptions associated with their most likely business development scenarios , and secondly to help them identify decisions that would help protect or increase the value of their technology or company . quantifying technical , regulatory or commercial risks can sometimes be a challenge . in technology - intensive fields , however , we have found that managers ( often scientists ) are quite willing to describe the main sources of risk and to assess the probability that a risky event may or may not occur . how does this kind of risky decision - making relate to real options valuation ? you can ' t say what the value of an asset is until you decide what you might use it for . this means that , to form an opinion about the value of an asset , you must explore the most important decisions that you are likely to face and that will have a significant impact on the value of the asset . so decision analysis helps to define the business problem and to uncover a stream of inter - related choices that are , in effect , " real options " . for example , if a company is trying to decide whether to invest in a risky project , does it have the option to pull the plug on the investment at an early stage if a pilot project gives a poor showing ? that " real " option reduces the riskiness , and increases the potential value , of the original business plan . so real options and decision analysis are really very close to one another . but you don ' t have to believe in real options valuations to find decision analysis useful . what do you mean ? often decision analysis can help managers to identify the key risks in a strategic decision , attach weights to these , and show clearly how they interact . for many companies this " risk discovery " is the most valuable part of the exercise . real options theory has been criticised recently for being , well , not very realistic . is it a practical approach to valuation ? it ' s important not to hold out unrealistic hopes for the real options approach to valuation . but it ' s an exciting methodology , and it ' s also sometimes the only reasonable way of tackling a very practical problem . for example , when a firm sells an asset , the firm might have to make an independent valuation of the asset for legal or corporate governance reasons . but in many businesses today there are assets that simply cannot be valued in traditional ways because they are difficult to link to cashflows . the cashflows might not exist because the business is so novel , or they might be hidden . in some respects , a real options analysis is much closer to reality than a traditional valuation . how , exactly ? the classic way of valuing a future business is to base the calculation on a single discounted cashflow that is projected from the activity . but this doesn ' t really take account of the way that scenarios can change , or the fact that managers can react to situations as they unfold . i mentioned earlier the option to kill a project or business at an early point . but the upside is that if a pilot project yields exciting results , it might allow you to invest more quickly and reach a revenue - generating position in a much shorter time than the original business plan allows . so to value a future business we really need to look at the cashflows that might arise in a number of scenarios . this is " realistic " in that , if the project gets the green light , you can bet that its managers will be taking that kind of decision on the ground all of the time . what ' s the most challenging part of mapping out a decision analysis tree ? modelling the links between the variables in the decision tree - - it ' s something we have particular strengths in . but it ' s also tricky to know when it ' s worthwhile to add on more detail , and when it ' s better to draw back . in a recent erisk interview , rick buy , chief risk officer of enron , said that over the two years that enron had experimented with the real options concept , it had found it of " limited , but not zero , use " . why is there a slight air of cynicism about real options in some businesses today ? it ' s strange that enron would profess this attitude . a few years ago , it was widely reported to have used real option valuation to support a very profitable purchase decision . they had apparently bought cheaply some older generators in the us that generated electricity at a very high cost . they knew that they could mothball them for most of the year , and switch them on only when the electricity prices were sufficiently high . nevertheless , from a customer ' s point of view , there might have been too much hype about the methodology . one problem in the application of real options technology is that there are , perhaps , too many people trying to tweak reality to conform to their " perfect " model . it ' s better to aim for something pragmatic that clearly improves decisions over time . in one pharmaceutical company we worked with recently , we worked together to improve their valuation analyses by moving from a single discounted cash - flow methodology to one that took into account a rather small set of business scenarios . it would have shocked some academics and consultants , but it was an undeniable improvement on the original approach . why do you think financial institutions are only just picking up on your field , when it ' s been applied in the energy industry for 15 years or more ? it might have something to do with the relative stability of the banking world until recently , and the relatively high margins that banking lines have enjoyed . also , industries such as energy and pharmaceuticals tend to have more people with an engineering and science background . the dynamic modelling of decisions is based on methodologies originally dreamed up to help engineers design electrical and electronic systems . this approach is quite distinct from the black - scholes options analyses that the banking world is familiar with : the black - scholes approach is difficult to apply in a real options context , because everything depends on the assumptions that you put into the black - scholes model . the real options approach , on the other hand , is in a sense a way of modelling those assumptions more explicitly . but banks are now adopting some of the thinking , particularly in terms of using decision analysis to pinpoint risks and identify value - enhancing decisions , and in using real options methodologies to sort the wheat from the chaff in their more speculative investments . you mean their internet investments ? we have recently worked with a major dutch bank that had arrived late in the internet game , and then made a considerable number of investments . now that even b 2 b business models have questions marks hanging over them , and many b 2 c businesses are already under water , they wanted to work out which investments might contain real value . in this situation , it ' s a case of ranking priorities and helping the bank make sense of what could turn into a decision - making chaos , rather than sophisticated valuation . it ' s not just a case of whether an internet investment should be killed off , but the problem of whether continued funding for it should take priority over budget demands for major it upgrades in existing businesses , and so on . these are very practical questions and they have to be answered somehow . are there other areas in financial institutions that seem accessible to this approach ? yes , for example , we think it can help work out the value associated with various approaches to marketing a new bank business line . at the moment , many banks are chasing high - net - worth individuals , but it ' s not always clear which kind of individual a particular bank should decide to pursue . the bank might have a regional or industry advantage already in one particular area , for example , music business people . but what is the churn rate associated with this kind of customer ? what is the profitability associated with the customer segment ? will the time and cost benefits of the advantages the bank has in the sector outweigh any disadvantages ? weighing up this kind of complex problem , where one thing leads to and depends on another , is what decision and real options analysis is good at . is there any way of rigorously backtesting or validating real options valuations ? in all honesty , not really . the problem is that by the time the option is exercised , many of the variables surrounding it will have changed , so it ' s difficult to compare our original analysis with how things turn out . however , the value of the analysis comes not only from the final number ( " the value of this asset is x " ) but also from providing a thorough process , an outsider ' s point of view , an understanding of the sources of value and , in short , a bit of clearer thinking . if real options are so important , why are they so rarely cited in communications to shareholders and equity analysts ? the battle is still to convince companies to use real option valuations as a significant part of their internal analysis . even in major companies in the oil & gas , and pharmaceutical sectors , where the ideas have taken some root internally , there seems to be a lot of reluctance to use them in external communication . we are working with analysts to understand better what they need to if we are to move things on to the next step . how does the riskiness of a business , in terms of the major strategic dilemmas it faces , relate to its share value , and its capital structure ? that ' s a big question . it ' s related to work my colleagues do on the optimal debt - to - equity capital structure and gearing of a corporation , which in turn arises out of the likely revenue and cost volatilities of the business . the more volatile the business , the less gearing it can sustain , and the higher the cost of capital . our work touches on this in the sense that exercising ( many ) specific real options can allow a firm to change its nature , and thus also its risk profile . one classic example is the pharmaceutical industry . a host of different kinds of companies service that industry from " big pharma " companies through to smaller biotechnology startups and run - of - the - mill contract research organisations . a contract research organisation is often operating within a very competitive environment with relatively few risks - - it does not invest in drug development itself - - but also very thin margins . but in fact , a few of these companies have used the skills and knowledge they have developed to become much more substantial and profitable healthcare companies of various kinds . it ' s an example of a company exercising the real options that lie within its skills and assets to transform its own identity . rob jameson , erisk HAM

 Subject: henwood & psim stinson / vince , the henwood runs for dabhol are , at least temporarily , over . however , the main modeller for henwood ( david yumigada ) works out of their california office . it maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs , and explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group . in aparticular , now that i am going through some of the comments people have raised on the psim model , i think there is value in understanding the way henwood deals with hot and cold starts , ramp up costs , and with issues of cycling plants . i think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the psim , and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models . this is a suggestion , and so please let me know if you see value in this . regards , sandeep .

( f - pcr ) technology uses live animal blood to detect the presence of infectious diseases and for the development of vaccines for such blood born diseases . it also allows for the efficient , effective , and continuous testing , management and treatment of animal populations . these facts distinguish the technology from any alternative testing and management methodology available to agriculture today - - all of which require the destruction of individual animals and even entire herds . our testing and data analysis processes also allow us not only to separate infected from clean animals , but also to gain knowledge vital to development of preventative vaccines . to date , genethera has successfully developed the assay ability to detect mad cow and chronic wasting disease , a disease affecting elk and deer in north america . diagnostic assays for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease are in the final stages of development . vaccines for e . coli ol 57 : h 7 and johnne ' s disease , both of which are diseases affecting cattle , are in advanced stages of development . in the future , the company plans to expand assay application research to a wide range of diseases / animals , the immediate targets being mad cow , hoof mouth , west nile and newcastle . genethera can detect bse using the companies patented live animal blood test that evaluates the e . d . r . f . gene sequence . the e . d . r . f . gene is proven to decrease dramatically before any tse infection is noticeable in a live animal or human . the patent gtha holds is broad based and can detect all tse diseases including mad cow ( bse ) in cattle , cwd in elk deer and creutzfeld - jacobs in humans the company ' s patented test can detect these diseases faster than any other method developed in the marketplace and at far less a cost . the test can also be used on a mass scale using roche f - pcr , dna analyzing robotics equipment . genethera can analyze over 2000 blood samples a day with one f - pcr machine and a single technician . the project will prove highly profitable at approx $ 4 . 00 per test when wide scale commercialization is under way . a multi - billion dollar , international demand for commercial mad cow testing has emerged around the globe . japan conducted 3 million post - mortem rapid mad cow tests last year alone . they used the western blot developed by prionics ag in swizterland and bio - rad ' s rapid test . costs are between $ 20 and $ 40 dollars per test . most importantly , other tests in the marketplace cannot detect the disease until the animal has been killed . testing through post - mortem brain tissue exams is extremely labor intensive and costly . japan spent between $ 60 million - $ 120 million on 3 million post mortem rapid mad cow tests in 2004 . genethera ' s simple blood test can be collected using their patented field collection system . the sample is then mailed to the lab for testing . the company also stated in their recent 10 k that they are currently in negotiations with strategic testing partners that we believe will absorb the costs of commercializing our live animal mad cow test . management : dr . tony milici -

 Subject: otc gdvi - the momentum continues - gdvi website debute otc bbalert gdvi news update : global diversified industries debutes brand new website ! www . gdvi . net otc bb alert spectacular operating results momentum continues sales projections for next 12 months surpasses $ 20 million 99 . 8 % revenue increase 278 % net income increase 154 % stockholders equity increase 79 % increase in assets $ 8 million order backlog $ 50 million manufacturing capacity overview global diversified industries operates in the modular building construction industry , and strategically targets the california education sector . gdvi is strategically located in central california on 16 acres with a 100 , 000 square foot state - of - the - art manufacturing facility . throughout 2003 and 2004 the company focused on building its infrastructure through acquisitions , development of a state - of - the - art manufacturing facility , and by securing the requisite financing facilities to fuel business growth . through the combination of its new facility ( $ 50 million capacity ) , the increased demand for portable buildings and the state of california ' s bond approvals , gdvi has become well positioned to become one of the dominant leaders in modular manufacturing on the west coast . gdvi should benefit greatly from the $ 12 . 1 billion school improvement bond that is expected to be passed by california voters next month ( march ) . this presents , in our opinion an opportunity for early investors of gdvi to also benefit before the mainstream investor realizes who the benefactors are and subsequently invests in those companies . global diversified has taken numerous strategic development steps throughout 2003 and 2004 , including generating strong revenues as well as profits and is now poised for explosive growth in 2005 . the company is led by a strong management team with previous success in building companies into $ 50 million per annum businesses . in the past year gdvi has exceeded its own sales revenue projections , renewed its piggyback contract , received state approvals on engineered product designs , started a new credit facility and opened its new 100 , 000 square foot manufacturing facility . the company will continue to seek new acquisition candidates through its aggressive growth plan . profile gdvi is a holding company that currently operates two wholly owned subsidiaries , mbs construction inc . , a modular contractor specializing in modular construction site work and renovation and global modular , inc . , a sales , marketing and manufacturing of modular type structures . its principal customer base is currently educational ( public and private schools , universities , etc . ) , child - care and municipality sectors . its product lines consist of a variety of portable classroom designs , including both single - story and two - story floor plans . global modular ' s portable classroom structures are engineered and constructed in accordance with pre - approved building plans , commonly referred to as p . c . ' s or pre - checked plans , that conform to structural and seismic safety specifications administered by the california department of state architects ( dsa ) . global modular also enjoys the benefit of providing educational customers with products contracted under a piggyback clause . the state of california allows school districts to canvass proposals from modular classroom vendors under a bidding process where the successful bidder can provide other public school districts and municipalities portable classrooms under a piggyback contract issued by the originating school district . this process saves school districts valuable time and resources from the necessity of soliciting bids . a modular vendor who possesses a piggyback contract containing competitive pricing and a variety of design options may have access to future business for up to five years , depending on the term of the piggyback contract . the strategic focus on california schools since 1998 , california legislation has required that at least 20 % of all new classrooms constructed with state funds be portable structures . there are five compelling reasons for this trend : modular classrooms are faster to construct ( as quickly as 2 weeks ) they cost significantly less ( as low as $ 30 , 000 vs . $ 100 , 000 ) they offer greater flexibility for use compared to conventional buildings they are easier to finance they provide financing incentives to cope with population growth , the state department of education estimates that california will need more than 2 , 500 classrooms each year for the next four years , which equates to more than 10 , 000 classrooms . due to the current and projected budget cuts throughout the california education sector , public and private schools are expected to turn to portable / modular construction to fulfill their additional classroom requirements over the next four years . the california schools budget crisis on november 5 , 2002 a $ 13 . 2 billion school facilities improvements bond proposal ( proposition 47 ) was passed by california voters . this bond measure passage does not include an approximate $ 9 . 4 billion worth of local bond measures passed by various school districts throughout the state . a second bond measure worth $ 12 . 1 billion went before the voters on the march 2004 . these bond measures are about three times higher than the record $ 9 . 2 billion bond california voters approved in 1998 . the revenue generated from these bond measures will be used for school modernization programs , which include requirements for relocatable classrooms and modular classroom construction and renovations . money from the bonds will help overcrowded public and private schools ; design upgrades and expand building space at community colleges and other institutions of higher learning throughout california . gdvi business infrastructure among global modular ' s asset base is its integrated , state - of - the - art , automated manufacturing process which includes equipment , raw material and marketing collateral that are specifically designed for the high capacity fabrication of modular structures . gdvi employs a workforce of 60 employees and is looking to add to its workforce as demand increases . operates out of a sixteen acre site with a 100 , 000 square foot operating structure . wholly owned subsidiary ( global modular inc . ) markets , designs and manufactures the buildings wholly owned subsidiary ( mbs corporation ) handles installation and building renovation . symbol otc . bb gdvi recent price 13 . 5 cents management team philip hamilton , ceo and president mr . hamilton has an extensive and very successful background in modular manufacturing . from 1996 to feb 2000 he served as chairman and ceo of pacesetter industries inc . he built this company from inception into one of californias largest manufacturers , producing and installing thousands of schools and commercial buildings . under his leadership , pacesetter industries moved into a 5 , 500 , 000 sq . ft . facility in atwater , california with branch sales offices throughout the state . the company employed a staff of over 650 employees and had annual sales of $ 50 , 000 , 000 . adam de bard , vice president mr . de bard has over 6 years of experience in the manufacturing and business sectors . from 1997 to 2000 he served as vice president and chief information officer of pacesetter industries . ronald kilpatrick , director of finance mr . kilpatrick has 36 years experience in both domestic and international development and management of major corporations . he is a managing partner of pacific rim capital llc which provides venture capital to projects in the pacific rim . recent headlines global diversified industries , inc . commencing efforts to increase its u . s . based investor and public relations visibility pr newswire ( tue 5 : 00 am ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division secures new order worth more than $ 3 million for immediate delivery pr newswire ( thu , jun 9 ) wallst . net airing all - new , exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and geoi pr newswire ( tue , jun 7 ) wallst . net airing exclusive audio interviews with gdvi and xle pr newswire ( thu , jun 2 ) global diversified industries , inc . acquires valuable assets from california modular company pr newswire ( thu , may 26 ) global diversified industries , inc . modular division implementing its fourth production line pr newswire ( thu , may 19 ) talkingstocks . com announces interview with philip hamilton , president and ceo of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( tue , may 17 ) stockguru . com initiates profile coverage of global diversified industries , inc . primezone media network ( mon , may 16 ) global diversified industries ' modular division billings total $ 1 . 4 million in april ;

 Subject: partnership mr . edward moko 18 independence close , johannesburg , south africa . dear sir / madam we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa . i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come . i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a " heir apparent to the throne " hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign " agreement " , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards . as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process . i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address . respectfully mr . edward moko .
