 Subject: spinaker / n . padre island block 883 : allocations per our various discussions , i am sending an email to reiterate the disposition of volumes at meter 9862 , the lehman spinaker pay meter . at this time , the general land office is transporting their share of production ( 21 . 8945 % interest ) and hpl is purchasing the remaining 78 . 1055 % . the glo has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848 , effective september 1 , 2000 . during this time , some test gas flowed . i have had the hpl purchase back - dated to coincide with the transport nomination , and have had both deals moved to 9862 . the meter should probably be designated a callout / swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after the production month by volume management . for october production forward , i am going to re - rank / confirm the pay meter to ensure that the glo receives a volume which should be close to their percentage after actuals close for the month . this should alleviate any large balance swings on their agreement . anita : for september , i need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket 379424 ; hpl gathering agmt . at meter 9862 . please unallocate the transport and purchase at 9848 . the meter is a daily swing right now . let me know when you are ready and i will change the allocation methodology . i apologize for the length of this email , i want to make sure that we are all on the same page , to the extent that we need to be , prior to this deal getting too far down the road . please do not hesitate to call me if you have any questions , comments , concerns , etc . i am at extension 35251 . thank you all for your time and patience , mary HAM

 Subject: change of control provisions as many of you know , i have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $ 20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of enron . the merger with dynegy , or a similar transaction with any other company , would trigger this provision on closing . assuming the merger with dynegy is closed within 6 - 9 months , as we expect , this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $ 60 million . many ceos have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989 . but given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees , i have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment . initially , i thought i would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash . however , after talking to a number of employees this afternoon , i have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment . therefore , at closing , i will receive no payments under this provision . i know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face . but please know that i will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of enron ' s employees and shareholders . i am still very proud of what we have built at enron , and i want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore enron to its rightful place in the energy industry . thank you .

[ pinion , richard ] to restate the question for clarity , in path manager a scheduler pulls down a supply , market and a service , adds any up / downstream contract information and / or duns or drn override and then saves it . unify looks for an old path with those exact variables and if it finds it re - uses it and if it does not find an exact match creates a new path and path id . i had been told that to do away with this function would create an unacceptably high amount of paths since any path once nominated on could not be deleted . has this changed ? ? ? at one time there were some schedulers that looked for the same path / activity number match for nominations . texas eastern was the only pipeline that needed the old activity numbers no matter how long it had been since they were used . i spoke with chris ordway and the new link system no longer needs this to occur . transco uses activity numbers but uses the activity number cross reference table to that function and therefore should not be affected . therefore , if it does not create a space or memory problem for unify , i don ' t think that this constant old path look up is needed . [ kinsey , lisa ] get rid of this . 2 ) the scheduling position window : does anyone use this ? if not , we ' ll remove the code logic that populates this window . i have never seen a scheduler use this . please verify . [ pinion , richard ] originally such a window was in use by everyone in the legacy system " autonoms " so it was duplicated in unify by request . it is not used in unify now because of the other sophisticated tools unify provides which obviate it ' s use . the only value would be notification of bridge errors or contract imbalances but there are other ways to determine those problems . as voted on in a previous meeting of the managers - lose it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] why is this still here ? 3 ) on the inventory pool list , does anyone need to see the contarct references list ? again , this code is called every retrieval time and doesn ' t appear to be used from my observations . if they do need this information , we could provide it , but if not , i ' d prefer to remove the functionality . [ pinion , richard ] this function is still very much in use by those with point based pipelines that must use the imbalance pool to facilitate balancing nomination volumes where multiple pipeline external pools exist and are pathed through the same contract imbalance pool . keep it ! [ kinsey , lisa ] yes . we use this functionality a lot when pathing pools . 4 ) when pathing a one to many or many to one set of paths , what ' s the average number of paths they create at one time ? what about updates ? i know that anr and nigas are big users of this feature since they have small packages of gas that they are limited in size to . does the system seem faster when you update one record at a time or chunks of records ? my real question is how often they do this and for what number of paths on both updates and inserts . by update , i mean , going to the path list and changing an upstream / downstream contract or a psna which in turn forces a new path to be created . [ pinion , richard ] this one to many or many to one pathing goes on every day on every pipeline . there is no ' average ' . they typically update a path with up / downstream meters or duns or dnb numbers one at a time however . i hope this answers your question . i see no change to this process at this time [ kinsey , lisa ] on some pipes this function is used more than others . when it is used we try and do as many paths as possible . at this time i do not see a need to change this process . 5 ) on brokered paths , do you want to utilize the same logic we have for service ? in other words , when updating brokered arrangements , we don ' t incorporate the same logic for zeroing out the path and recreating a new arrangment link and hence sending it to be renominated ? why do we do this for service ? is it because we have to renominate it ? i assume that ' s what it ' s for since we don ' t send brokered paths to the pipe . anyway , with the nomlogic implmentation ( two way interface ) , we were planning on having it behave the same way as service . we need this verified . [ pinion , richard ] we don ' t perform the same logic for brokered paths because these are not nominated to the pipeline and hence do not need a zero path to be resent to the pipeline when a significant change is made to the already nominated path . i don ' t see a need to change the way brokered paths are behaving at this time . [ kinsey , lisa ] agree with richard . HAM

 Subject: texas market analysis team : i have asked troy denetsosie to be responsible for compiling and updating a detailed supply , market and infrastructure analysis of texas . this information will support both our origination and trading activities and we will use a lot of the format ( website and other ) developed by the other regions . spcifically , troy will offload a lot the analysis work that jd is currently doing on the market side and he will work closely with bryan hull to support the more immediate needs of the traders . the deliverables from troy will be : ( 1 ) a texas section on the gas fundamentals webpage modeled after the central region , ( 2 ) a daily report on gas flows , deals , basis positons , etc . , ( 3 ) a detailed infrastructure analysis ( maps , flows , etc ) that will support the development of our supply / market hub positions . please give him your support . regards , brian - - - - - original message - - - - - from : bryan , gary sent : friday , september 21 , 2001 10 : 42 am to : redmond , brian subject : fw : crm database as you know , much of jd , mark and my time to date has been geared around finding what companies , customers , phone numbers and past business that we may have done with the customers we started with and move forward from that starting point . in the few short weeks we have addressed , uncovered and started down the road to what i hope to be a very profitable 2001 - 2002 . the crm database should be a great tool for those that follow . it appears that the originators would log in calls , meetings and any other business that gets discussed with the customer . this would have been a great tool for our group to have had in starting from ground zero . there still appears to be some developmental issues around this program . in the meantime , we are using a number of spreadsheets to keep up with our business . should the crm database not be approved or delayed , we have decided to populate the act 2000 ! database . this is currently supported by enron but is not as user friendly as the crm would be . the cost for act 2000 ! is relatively free ! if you have any questions , please let me know . - - - - - original message - - - - - from : buss , jd sent : friday , september 21 , 2001 9 : 14 am to : bryan , gary ; knippa , mark ; redmond , brian subject : crm database on thursday of this past week i went to a meeting regarding the crm database which is designed by siebel for the purpose of handling customer information . the crm database has only been implemented with trading / origination groups within enron and provides the following capabilities : 1 . account & contact management 2 . activity tracking & planning 3 . potential deal management 4 . outlook synchronization 5 . remote connectivity / synchronization 6 . e - mail from siebel and records activity the current enron groups that use this system are the enron industrial markets that was implemented in may 2001 and the freight markets that was implemented in august 2001 . the following is a list of how these groups have been utilizing the system : industrial mkts freight mkts users 175 45 counterparties 8 , 200 20 , 000 contacts 14 , 000 20 , 000 activities 1 , 200 900 quotes 150 opportunities 361 11 the following groups have also inquired about this system and having it implemented : eol global mkts ees transportation east power orig insolvent debt some of the basic costs and timeline for this system are $ 120 - $ 150 , 000 for 20 - 30 users with a 5 week timeline for implementation . this is a basic implementation that may not include all of the functionality shown above ( i . e . , no remote connectivity ) . the reason that i have written this is to show a possible system that could be used by the gas floor origination and trading groups to manage contact information and share data among groups . the cost to implement this for all of the origination groups does not appear to be prohibitive and it could be implemented in a good time frame . some of the issues are coordination among the groups and the desire to share information . let me know if you think this is a viable possibility and what would be the best way to approach the other origination groups . colin tonks , database / system guy , within the fundamentals group was also at the meeting and thinks this would work great . he would be the individual coordinating efforts from the natural gas system side . thanks , jd HAM
 Subject: proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates ngi ' s daily gas price index breaking news : posted sep 26 , 4 : 16 pm proposed rule extends marketing affiliate regulations to all affiliates federal energy regulatory commissioners wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers , including both natural gas pipelines and power lines , to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate . previously , the rules simply required creation of a firewall , including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel , between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates . the proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate , gas or electric , including financial affiliates . the commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates , which still in many cases have bundled operations . one option would enforce complete separation , while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load . staff and commissioners wood , william massey and nora brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel , so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non - affiliated competitors did not have access to . commissioner linda breathitt , however , argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load . breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities , she was concerned about the timing . " i see no compelling reason at this time ; there have been no complaints and no evidence . " she said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction . " i agree with concept philosophically , but i think there will be other opportunities later on , after we do a little more bridge - building with state commissions . " wood said he understood " the political issue here with respect to federal - state relations , but i think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated . " staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems , waivers could be granted . staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel . " if i am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load , i can go into the control room and get all the information i want , " one staffer responded . wood proposed , and the commissioners ratified , a proposed rule with no exceptions , but which makes clear that in the final rule the commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required . commenting parties should provide cost / benefit analysis on both sides of the question . state commissions are also invited to comment . wood had suggested the commission extend the separation to all sales employees , " but make it clear that if we don ' t hear from people that they really want this separation , we ain ' t going to do it .

 Subject: new tax law update whether you ' re investing for your kids ' education or your retirement , the new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach . the $ 1 . 35 - trillion tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas , from investing for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes . many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years . but to help you take advantage of all possible provisions , we should start planning soon . some of the ways you may benefit include : lower income tax rates . the gradual reduction of tax rates has already begun . in fact , the new withholding schedule went into effect on july 1 . and , you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new 10 % bottom rate retroactive to january 1 , 2001 . as tax rates fall over the next few years , your disposable income will likely rise - offering an opportunity to invest more toward your various goals . education - funding incentives . parents who want to help their children attend college may now find their financial task easier . the tax relief act will improve education savings tools such as : ? education iras - the accounts ' contribution limit will rise from $ 500 to $ 2 , 000 in 2002 . what ' s more , money in these accounts can now be used for elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education expenses . ? state sponsored 529 college savings plans - also beginning in 2002 , distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax free . currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the beneficiary ' s rate upon withdrawal . 529 s are particularly attractive due to their generous contribution limits . ? deductions for education expenses - the act increases eligibility for student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher education expenses . ? the child tax credit - though not tied specifically to education expenses , this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college . previously $ 500 per qualifying child under 17 , the credit increases to $ 600 in 2001 - 2004 , $ 700 in 2005 - 2008 , $ 800 in 2009 and $ 1 , 000 in 2010 and thereafter . higher retirement plan contribution limits . the tax act will allow people with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and iras - possibly helping them retire sooner and more comfortably . your options may include : ? traditional and roth iras - annual contribution limits for both of these types of iras will gradually rise from $ 2 , 000 this year to $ 5 , 000 in 2008 . after that , the limits will be indexed to inflation in $ 500 increments . ? 401 ( k ) s and 403 ( b ) s - working individuals also may be able to invest more in their employer retirement plan . the limit on elective deferrals will gradually rise from $ 10 , 500 this year to $ 15 , 000 in 2006 , and this doesn ' t include the catch - up contribution provision for people 50 years and older . and much more . there are other provisions in the new tax law that may benefit you and your family . when we meet , we ' ll identify the ones that apply to you and help you make the most of them . as you can see , the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number of areas . but because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be flexible enough to react to year - by - year changes . such planning is where american express financial advisors excels . i ' m backed by a corporate team of specialists in taxation , investments , estate and retirement planning , and more to help you make the most of your finances . let me know if you have any questions . i look forward to seeing you . byron " make all you can , save all you can , give all you can .

 Subject: tenaska iv agency fee can you clarify for me how the agency fee is suppose to be calculated ? i am getting mixed information . i know that we use the higher of the two volumes ( receipts vs . deliveries ) . the question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume . last month ( march ) , we left the volume at the nom of 45 , 000 / day . in the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume . for april , the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47 , 089 / day . james armstrong is using the actual volume . the deal for the fee is 514353 . my other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes , receipts , deliveries and transport . should the transport volume be in the calculation ? also , mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume . do i include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom ? if you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee , i would like to have a copy . you can fax it to 713 - 571 - 3141 . if none of this makes sense , give me a call and i can try and explain further . thanks , megan 713 - 571 - 3261 HAM

" and i think the responsibility on that lies with the palestinian authority . " shortly after the first blast , a second explosion was heard in southern gaza , but its precise location was not immediately known . hamas , in a phone call to cnn , said it had set off the first explosion near rafah in cooperation with a group called the fatah hawks . there was no immediate information available on that group , although it was believed to be linked to the fatah movement formerly led by the late palestinian leader yasser arafat . israeli military sources said it was a coordinated attack , with palestinians firing mortar shells and guns at the post when the explosives were detonated . it was not clear whether there were palestinian casualties . news video of the aftermath showed soldiers using stretchers to transport troops who appeared to be severely wounded . in a pamphlet distributed after the attack , hamas said it had used 1 . 5 tons of explosives and had recorded video of the incident . palestinians have used tunnels in the area to smuggle weapons from egypt . israel has carried out operations to crack down on the smuggling . shell explosion in schoolyard an israeli tank shell exploded in a gaza schoolyard sunday morning , wounding eight palestinian schoolchildren , palestinian medical and security sources said . the children between the ages of 6 and 12 - - sustained moderate to light injuries , the sources said . the violence happened in khan yunis in central gaza israeli military sources said that forces in the area identified what they thought was a number of mortar shells being fired towards israeli settlements nearby . in response , the forces fired towards the positions with light weapons , but did not fire a tank shell , the military sources said .
