# Email Classification
Since C3PO is easily bothered by spam, it's better to choose a classifier that is more toward the top-right of the ROC curve. The reason is that as the classifier gets closer to the top-rights, it classifies more input as "positive" or in our case, SPAM, which is ideal for this person (even some actual HAM emails might be classified as SPAM).
On the contrary, R2D2 cares more about not missing HAM emails. Therefore, a suitable classifier for this person should be very cautious with labeling SPAM, and should be closer to the bottom-left of ROC curve, where more emails are classified as negative (or HAM, in our case).
